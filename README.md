# 10-bit RISC Processor Implementation (CSE332 Project)

## Overview
This project involves the design and implementation of a 10-bit Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) processor using Logisim. The goal is to create a functional processor with a minimal instruction set, emphasizing simplicity and efficiency.

## Features
- 10-Bit Architecture: The processor operates on a 10-bit instruction word, ensuring a compact design.
- RISC Principles: The architecture follows RISC principles, focusing on a reduced set of instructions to enhance performance.
- Limited Instruction Set: A small yet versatile instruction set is implemented, covering essential operations such as load, store, arithmetic, and branching.

## Getting Started
- Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/10-bit-RISC-Processor.git
- Open the project in Logisim and explore the processor's architecture.
- Please refer to the 'Project ISA' file for detailed information

## Usage
- Simulating the Processor: Run the Logisim simulation to observe the processor's behavior.
- Testing: Execute test programs to ensure the correct implementation of instructions.
